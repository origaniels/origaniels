# About Me
## Education
Studied in scientific French high school and graduated with outstanding grades.

Began studies in the intense CPGE schools where I learned about Abstract Mathematics, Physics and Computer Science.

Entered the French National School of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics ([ENSIMAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_nationale_sup%C3%A9rieure_d%27informatique_et_de_math%C3%A9matiques_appliqu%C3%A9es_de_Grenoble)) through a highly selective and competitive nation-wide entrance exams. I had the chance to study, among other subjects, Information Theory, Network Engineering, Hardware architecture, Systems Programming and Algorithms and Language Processing.

## Computer Science Interests

I'm passionnate about basically anything related to low level programming. 

That invovles:
- **Computer Architecture**
- **Computer Networking**
- **low level memory optimizations**: cache/SRAM/DRAM optimmizations.
- **Operating Systems and kernels**
- **Compiler Design**: Added features to the GCC implementation of a company I worked with.
- **Embedded Systems**
- **Parallel Programmming**: multi-threaded programming is really fun
- **Hardware Design** is interesting as well but not my biggest interest compared to the rest.

On a side note I do like **computer vision** as well.

## Programming languages

- **C(++)**: highly proficient, experience writing OS kernel including bitwise manipulations on RISCV CSRs, writing multi-threaded applications and various memory optimisations. As a simple example checkout this [computer vision](https://github.com/origaniels/pgm_image_processing) project I wrote
- **Python**: highly proficient, used mainly to write scripts to help debugging or performance monitoring, and not as full-fledged applications. I do own and maintain an old [discord music bot](https://github.com/origaniels/rem)
- **Rust**: beginner to intermediate. Attempted training an AI to play a minimal flappy bird clone written in it from scratch (wrote the game and the neural network library). Though currently the project is on hold.
- **Java**: Proficient, wrote a compiler for a minimal object oriented toy language as a school project, featuring LLVM IR code generation.
- **Build Systems**: Significant experience with **Make**, **CMake**, **Meson**.
- **Scripting**: **Bash/Zsh** and other shells.
  ...
- **HTML/JS/CSS**: Experience as part of school projects, wrote a small [instant messaging app](https://github.com/orgs/54giri-studios/repositories) using the [tauri](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri) Rust web Framework. Web programming isn't my cup of tea.
